# TrackPlottingScriptLab.mlx: up-to-date backup of matlab script used to plot cyclone tracks. 
# TrackPlottingScriptNordic.mlx: up-to-date backup of matlab script used to plot cyclone tracks. Virtually the same as the Lab version, but includes masking the lat/lon coordinates to -180 to 180.
# ConvR_HC_FWT.mlx: up-to-date backup of matlab script acquired from Pouneh, used to create matfiles of LAB60 output so the timeseries script can make a timeseries of model output. Convective resistance, heat content, freshwater content
# ConvR_HC_FWT_timeseries.mlx: up-to-date backup of matlab script acquired from Pouneh, used to produce timeseries of LAB60 output based on files generated in previous script.
